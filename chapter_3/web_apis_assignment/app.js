/*Web API Review
Nice job on this assignment.  You've parsed data.body three times when really you only needed to do it once.  From there you can access each value in the object
the same way you've done, but all from the same variable instead of tZ, temp, and sum.  Also you'll notice that when you console log the data you get back, it's 
returning data in the imperial scale instead of metric, there may have been something in the DarkSky API documentation to change that.

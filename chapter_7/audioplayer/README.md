Using React I built a minimal version of a web audio player app, allowing users to play songs on the web app while browsing music information.

Users can navigate between "songs list" page and "individual song details" page
There is a media control UI that let users play and pause a song from any page

Pressing the next or prev button while a song is being played will change the song and play it
Pressing the next or prev button while no song is being played will only change the song

Change in "current song" should be displayed to the user

The "songs list" page should show the list of song title with a link to the individual song page, and also a convenient play button next to it that will play that particular song

The "individual song details" page should show the song title and description, and also a convenient play button that will play that particular song
